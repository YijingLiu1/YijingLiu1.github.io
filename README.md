# PersonalWebsite-YijingLiu
This is a prototype of my future personal website. The website would have a home page with basic introduction of me, a page presenting my projects and work, and another page showing my contact info. Since I'm just getting started with projects like this one, I have my second page showing some of my favorite video games for now instead, displaying items in the form of slides, which can be later transformed into slides with my projects. The website link is here:

## Website Structure
The website consists of 3 pages.
* __Home__: This page is the index of the website. There is a header navigation bar with links to the other 2 pages. This page performs as an intro to the contents of the next 'Games' page. Each line of the intro texts will show up with a fade animation every second, guiding users to go to the next page.
* __Games__: This page shows video games I like in 3 different slides. Each slide presents one video game, with its graphic, title, short introduction and an external link to its official website. Users can access to each slide in following ways: <br>
    * The slide will switch in a loop automatically every 6 seconds.  <br>
    * Users can also press the "<" and ">" button at left and right to switch to other slides. <br>
    * There are 3 dots at bottom representing each slide. Clicking the dots would navigate users to the corresponding slide. <br>
* __About__: This page presents a brief info of my education background, my current programming skills and my contact information, with a background picture on the right. There are 3 tables showing the information respectively, with one icon and short description in each grid. The table is shown as default but users can choose to hide or show the table by clicking the "-" button on the top right of each table(buttons would turn "+" if rable is hidden). Users can click on the icons in the contact table to navigate to my email, my Facebook page and my LinkedIn page.

## Interactive Components
There are several interactive and animation components in the website. All buttons and links in the website have animation effects when the mouse hovers on them, as well as the contents in tables on "About" page. The slides are switched with a fade effect, to best serve the visual. Buttons are used for switching slides and showing or hiding tables. About page with tables hidden would be as below.
